I [Sahil](https://github.com/Sahil-k1509) would recommend Youtube if this is your starting in programming journey. Let me elaborate the advantages and suggest some channels.
  * There are literally 100s of videos on every topic, so you can watch other videos if you don't understand any part from a certain video.
  * If you are stuck at any point while following tutorials, Make sure to check out comments. I have solved a lot of my problems by just going through comments.
  * All the videos that are available on youtube are free. You may be tempted to think that free lectures aren't as good as paid courses but I have seen playlists on youtube that were better than coursera and udemy courses for same topics.
  * For python related topics, Check out: [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg) . This guy is a python genius and all a lot of tutorials covering python automation, machine learning/deep learning, pygame etc
  * For Best programming tutorials in any language, Follow: [Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ). You can finnd literally anything on their channel from app development to web development to Game developement to even penetration testing. Even Maths, statistics etc. Freecodecamp is a heaven for learners.
  * For Tutorials in Hindi and easy explanation, [Code With Harry](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVMnSShP_Iviwkknt83cww) is a perfect guy to follow. He has a lot of playlists covering many programming languages(PHP, JS, Python, C, C++, Java etc) and much more.
  * Other Channels: [Net ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) [programming knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/user/ProgrammingKnowledge)
  * Stack Overflow and geeksforgeeks is your friend if you are stuck and can't find solutions to it.

I [Partha](https://github.com/parth93QA) would recommend going through a basic functional programming language initailly like python or golang, then learn about databases and then move over to webdevelopment slowly remember even Rome was not built in a day so always keep learning and keep growing.I would recommed courses over udemy and for open source yoyou always have good documentation as well.

I also recommend Python basics using [Mike Dane on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpMMs5lskzBApYXn0bl7emsW) because he explains topics well while providing growing projects along the way.
