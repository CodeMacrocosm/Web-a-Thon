I [Sneha](https://github.com/Snehakri022) suggests you to Don’t give up early, It may take weeks to get started.

I [Anjali Soni](https://github.com/anjalisoni3655) suggest you to explore different fields be it machine learning, development, cyber security, etc atleast once. We will never know where we are actually interested if we dont give some time to explore that field by ourselves. Don't go with the current trend. Be yourself 🙂.
