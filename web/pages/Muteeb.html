      <h1>Muteeb's Coding Journey!</h1>
      <p>I started web development after watching a self-taught developer’s video on YouTube. At first, I thought to myself, “If he can do it, then surely I can too.” What I didn’t realize was how overwhelming the world of coding could feel at the beginning—so many technologies, languages, and tools to learn. But instead of giving up, I made a promise to myself: no matter what, I would stay consistent and dedicate at least a few hours every single day to learning and improving.</p>

      <p>Fast forward 10 months later, and I’ve completed certifications from platforms like Udemy, freeCodeCamp, and HackerRank, along with countless hours of YouTube tutorials and hands-on practice inside VS Code. Through this journey, I’ve built projects, solved problems, and gained confidence in both front-end and back-end development. Today, I’m proud to say that I consider myself a Full Stack Developer. One important lesson I’ve learned along the way is that growth never really ends in this field—technology evolves daily, and the best developers never stop learning, adapting, and challenging themselves.</p>
